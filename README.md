# Store-management-system
A complete store management system interactive website created for 4th sem database management system project.

The main aim of the Store management DBMS project is to keep a track of sales, purchases and their effect on inventory. We aim to demonstrate the use of create, read, update and delete operations through this project. The project starts by creating a seller, then a customer, purchasing some products from the seller (dealer) and note the changes to inventory, The
purchased goods can be modified later which demonstrates the update functionality of the project. Finally, we can record a sale and note the changes to product quantity in the inventory page.
